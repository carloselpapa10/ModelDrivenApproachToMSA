# Model-Driven Approach To Microservices Architecture (MSA)

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a branch of software engineering aiming at making the development of complex software systems easier, reducing the time to market, and increasing software quality. Model-driven approaches shift development focus from code expressed in third generation programming languages to models expressed in domain-specific modeling languages. This thesis proposes a model-driven approach to construct a model that covers the main concepts, features and components of the Microservices Architecture (MSA) systems. Moreover, a business architecture modeling is carried out to guarantee that all those concepts have a suitable implementation along the phases. Using this model most of the problems or drawback presented in MSA systems will be reduced and the user will be able to take advantage of the MDE techniques.
